# Mission to Mars

## Overview :
The goal of this project was to use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.


## Summary:

I used bootstrap 3 to style the webpage.  

 * Added a glyphicon check mark to the scrape data button
